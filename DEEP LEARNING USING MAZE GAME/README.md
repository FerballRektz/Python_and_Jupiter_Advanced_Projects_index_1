# Using Deep Q-learning to create Artifical General Intelligence to solve dynamic maze puzzles

## I. Objectives
the objective of the study is the ff:
1. to understand Q-learning and build it in python code  
2. to use Q-learning to solve Python maze game problem
## II. Scope 
the project is to manually compute Q-learning to create a Artitifical General Intelligence(AGI) to solve dynamic maze problem in python. The maze problem is created through python. The maze problem consist of a agent and a $n \times n$ matrix and a end point. The goal is to teach the agent using the q-learning algorithm to reach the maze end point at the shortest path. 
## III. Data used
There is no data used in the project

## IV. How the Project is done
the project consist of these three scripts
1. Q LEARNING FIRST CODE
first script to learn q-learning to create maze solving AGI
2. FROZEN_LAKE_WITH_RANDOM_MAZE_CODING_IRAO
creating q-learning algorithm to solve maze problem with random block at agent placing
3. FROZEN_LAKE_WITH_GREEDY_CODING_IRAO
creating q-learning algorithm with greedy algorithm to solve maze problem with random block at agent placing



## V. Results
all the scripts use the q-learning algorithm although some with little modification in relation to the maze problem. The Q-algorithm only downside is its mapping of its reward matrix which can be tedious. There is also the problem on how hard it is to make the maze problem itself. Overall these three scripts is a manual and step-to-step process on how the Q-learning algorithm works to create a maze solving AGI

## VI. Code and Project Reccomendations
there is both code and project reccomendations that needs to be addressed:
1. There needs to be a more efficent way to map a reward matrix in the q-learning algorithm rather than manually
2. There should a extension of this algoritm from 2d maze to 3d maze 
3. There should be more research on other ways to solve the maze problem
4. The creation of the maze problem can be improved and not be dependent of graphs 
3. You can use this as a inspiration or extension into understanding and learning AGI and its different types
